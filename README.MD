# About

## ðŸ’¼ Project Description

MealMind is a food tracking & meal planning app that helps people with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) improve their eating habits. As someone who suffers from both ARFID and ADHD, I know first-hand how difficult it is to just eat... especially when certain foods or textures are a struggle to eat... or when I just forget to eat all day for no other reason than "I forgot" (oops). That's why I created MealMind, to make meal planning an enjoyable and stress-free experience.

I wanted to challenge myself and learn a new tech stack that I've never used before, so I chose to build MealMind using Nextjs/Typescript, Material UI (and a tiny bit of Ant Design), and Supabase. I went through superplate's set up of Refine.dev and also set up React Hook Forms and light/dark mode. While I didn't have time to fully utilize the i18n (important for me as a spanish speaker) and kbar interface, I plan to incorporate them more in the future to make MealMind even more user-friendly.

Creating MealMind has been the most important project for me. I wanted to build a tool that not only helps me manage my own eating habits, but also helps others with similar struggles. That's why I'm excited to make this an open-source project (my very first one as well), so that others can benefit from it and contribute to its development. I hope that MealMind can help those with ARFID and ADHD feel more confident in their ability to plan and enjoy their meals, and I'm excited to see how it evolves as a community-driven project :)

### **refine Open Source Hackathon:**

*refine is a React-based framework for the rapid âœ¨ development of CRUD web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by CRUD operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts like authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n. refine shines on data-intensive applications like admin panels, dashboards, internal tools and storefronts.*

*We're proud to have reached thousands of developers who used refine in our first year, and we couldn't have done it without an open source community! To celebrate this achievement with the community, we are excited to announce the launch of the first hackathon event.*

*This hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to showcase their skills and learn refine!*
